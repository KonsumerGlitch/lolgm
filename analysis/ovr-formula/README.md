Goal: find a good formula for the overall rating "ovr" that tightly correlates
with PER. This is tricky because it's not a linear relationship, some ratings
combinations are symbiotic (like height and shot blocking).

Data was generated by playing version 2014.07.27.728, and not very actively
(user team doesn't do much better than AI teams). These JSON files were created
with the normal in-game "Export League" feature:

* `BBGM - League 1.json`: 23 seasons
* `BBGM - League 2.json`: 19 seasons
* `BBGM - League 3.json`: 16 seasons
* `BBGM - League 4.json`: 17 seasons
* `BBGM - League 5.json`: 18 seasons

Running `json2csv.py` converts then into the CSV file `data.csv`, selecting the
PERs and ratings for seasons above a certain minutes played cutoff.
